# Test Fixes Applied

## Issue
Tests were failing on GitHub Actions with the error:
```
supabaseUrl is required.
```

This occurred because the Supabase client was being initialized unconditionally without checking if environment variables were set.

## Changes Made

### 1. `BACKEND/src/middleware/auth.js`
- Modified Supabase client initialization to be conditional
- Added check for environment variables before creating client
- Added null check in `authenticateToken` middleware

### 2. `BACKEND/src/routes/auth.js`
- Modified Supabase client initialization to be conditional
- Added Supabase configuration checks in all auth routes:
  - `/login`
  - `/logout`
  - `/refresh`
  - `/me`

### 3. `BACKEND/src/tests/setup.js`
- Added environment variable defaults to prevent initialization errors
- Sets empty strings for Supabase variables if not provided

## How It Works Now

1. During test execution, if Supabase environment variables are not set:
   - The Supabase client will be `null`
   - Authentication routes will return 503 status with "Authentication service not configured"
   - Tests will run without actual Supabase authentication

2. During normal operation with Supabase configured:
   - Works exactly as before
   - Full Supabase authentication functionality

## Files Modified
- `BACKEND/src/middleware/auth.js`
- `BACKEND/src/routes/auth.js`
- `BACKEND/src/tests/setup.js`

## Testing
The fixes ensure that:
- Tests can run without Supabase configuration
- Tests that expect 401 errors will still receive them
- The server initializes successfully even without Supabase
