# ‚úÖ Fixed Prisma OpenSSL Error

## üîß Problem
```
Error loading shared library libssl.so.1.1: No such file or directory
```

Prisma needs OpenSSL but `node:20-alpine` doesn't scratch include it.

## ‚úÖ Solution

Changed Dockerfile from:
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine  ‚ùå
```

To:
```dockerfile
FROM node:20  ‚úÖ
```

`node:20` includes OpenSSL by default, solves the Prisma issue!

**Next**: Push to GitHub, Railway will work!

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Prisma OpenSSL issue - use node:20 instead of alpine"
git push origin main
```
