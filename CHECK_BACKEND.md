# üîç Check Backend Connection

## ‚úÖ What's Working
- Frontend is deployed
- UI loads correctly
- No login required
- Chatbot displays

## ‚ùå What's Not Working
- Cannot connect to Railway backend
- "Failed to get chat sessions"
- "Failed to send message"

## üîç Diagnostics

### Step 1: Check if Backend is Running

Open in browser:
```
https://lotusrepo-production-0265.up.railway.app/api/health
```

**What should happen:**
- Should return JSON like: `{"status": "ok"}`

**If error:**
- Backend not running in Railway
- Need to start/restart Railway service

### Step 2: Check Browser Console

1. Open your Vercel app
2. Press F12 (Developer Tools)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Try to send a message
5. Look for error messages

**What to look for:**
- Network error
- CORS error
- 404 Not Found
- Connection refused
- Timeout

### Step 3: Check Network Tab

1. Press F12
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try sending a message
4. Look for failed requests (red)

**Check:**
- What URL is it trying to reach?
- What error code? (404, 500, CORS, etc.)

## üéØ Most Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Backend Not Running
**Solution**: Check Railway dashboard, restart service

### Issue 2: Wrong API Endpoint
**Check**: What URL is the frontend trying to call?

### Issue 3: CORS
**Solution**: Railway backend needs to allow Vercel domain
