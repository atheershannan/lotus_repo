## 🎭 CHARACTER DEFINITIONS

### AI Architect
- **Role:** Technical decision maker
- **Focus:** System design, scalability, security
- **Perspective:** Long-term architecture

### Product Owner
- **Role:** Business requirements owner
- **Focus:** User needs, business value, prioritization
- **Perspective:** What users really need

### Team Lead
- **Role:** Implementation feasibility
- **Focus:** Resources, timeline, team capabilities
- **Perspective:** What's realistic to build

## 📝 DIALOGUE GENERATION RULES

For each key decision point from requirements:
1. **Architect** raises a technical concern
2. **Product Owner** explains business context
3. **Team Lead** proposes a balanced solution
4. **Agreement** is reached with rationale

---

## 🔄 EXAMPLE DIALOGUE STRUCTURE

### Decision Point: [Topic from Requirements]

**Architect:** "Looking at the MVP requirements, we need to consider [technical concern]. For example, if we expect [scenario], we should implement [approach A] vs [approach B]."

**Product Owner:** "I understand the concern, but from a user perspective, [business requirement]. Users really need [value proposition]. Can we achieve that with your suggestion?"

**Team Lead:** "Given our constraints of [constraint from Q6], I propose [balanced solution]. This addresses [technical need], ensures [business value], and is feasible within [timeline/resource]."

**Architect:** "I agree. This approach also allows for [future scalability consideration]."

**Decision:** [Recorded decision with rationale]
