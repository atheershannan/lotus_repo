# 🗄️ STAGE 6: DATABASE DESIGN

## 📋 Stage Overview

**Purpose**: Design and implement database schema
**Duration**: 4-6 hours
**Dependencies**: Stage 2 ✅ Complete
**Outputs**: Database schema, Migrations, Data models

## 🧬 Dynamic Question Phase

Before we start this stage, please answer the following questions:

### 1️⃣ Database Requirements
**What are your database requirements and constraints?**
- Database type: [PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.]
- Data volume: [Expected data size and growth]
- Performance needs: [Query performance requirements]
- Scalability: [Horizontal vs vertical scaling needs]

### 2️⃣ Data Relationships
**What are the relationships between your data entities?**
- Entity relationships: [One-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many]
- Data integrity: [Referential integrity requirements]
- Data consistency: [ACID compliance needs]
- Data validation: [Database-level validation requirements]

### 3️⃣ Data Access Patterns
**How will your application access the data?**
- Query patterns: [Read-heavy, write-heavy, balanced]
- Indexing strategy: [Primary keys, foreign keys, search indexes]
- Caching needs: [Query result caching, session caching]
- Data archiving: [Data retention and archiving needs]

### 4️⃣ Security and Compliance
**What are your data security and compliance requirements?**
- Data encryption: [At rest, in transit, field-level encryption]
- Access control: [Role-based access, row-level security]
- Compliance: [GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, etc.]
- Audit logging: [Data change tracking, access logging]

### 5️⃣ Backup and Recovery
**What are your backup and recovery requirements?**
- Backup frequency: [Daily, hourly, real-time]
- Recovery time: [RTO requirements]
- Recovery point: [RPO requirements]
- Disaster recovery: [Cross-region replication, failover]

2. **Design Database Schema**
3. **Create Data Models**
4. **Plan Indexing Strategy**
5. **Create Migration Scripts**
6. **Implement Security Measures**
7. **Set up Backup Procedures**
8. **Mark Stage Complete**

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] All dynamic questions answered
- [ ] Database schema designed
- [ ] Data models created
- [ ] Migration scripts written
- [ ] Indexing strategy planned
- [ ] Security measures implemented

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

- **Poor Schema Design**: Plan schema carefully
- **Missing Indexes**: Optimize query performance
- **Security Gaps**: Implement proper security
- **No Backup Strategy**: Plan for data recovery

## 🔄 Next Steps

After completing this stage:
1. Review database design
2. Validate data models
3. Mark stage complete in ROADMAP.md
4. Proceed to Stage 7: QA & Testing
