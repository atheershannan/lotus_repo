# 🎯 STAGE 08: IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW

> **⚠️ THIS IS WHERE ACTUAL CODING BEGINS**

---

## 📋 PREREQUISITES CHECKLIST

**Before starting this stage, ensure:**

- [ ] ✅ Stage 01: Requirements complete
- [ ] ✅ Stage 02: ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md complete
- [ ] ✅ Stage 03: Flow diagrams complete
- [ ] ✅ Stage 04: Backend TDD plans complete
- [ ] ✅ Stage 05: Frontend TDD plans complete
- [ ] ✅ Stage 06: Database schema complete
- [ ] ✅ Stage 07: Testing strategy complete

**All prior stages MUST be complete!**

---

## 🎯 THIS STAGE'S OBJECTIVE

Translate all TDD plans into **working code** following:

1. **Red-Green-Refactor cycle**
2. **TDD principles** (write tests first)
3. **Code review process** before merge
4. **80%+ test coverage** requirement

---

## 📂 IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### Phase 1: Backend Implementation
1. Write failing test (RED)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor and optimize
4. Run full test suite
5. Code review
6. Merge

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation
1. Write failing test (RED)
2. Implement minimal component (GREEN)
3. Refactor and optimize
4. Run full test suite
5. Code review
6. Merge

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Connect frontend to backend
2. Test end-to-end flows
3. Fix integration issues
4. Final code review
5. Two reviewer sign-offs
6. Ready for deployment

## 🛡️ SAFETY MECHANISMS

- **Never skip tests** - Every feature must have tests
- **Code review required** - No merge without review
- **Coverage enforced** - CI/CD fails if <80%
- **Documentation** - Code must be documented
- **Security checks** - Linting and security scans required

## 🚦 NEXT STAGE

Once implementation complete and all tests passing:
→ Proceed to **Stage 09: Deployment**

**Stage:** 08/09 (Implementation)  
**Duration:** 20-40 hours (estimated)  
**Next:** Stage 09 - Deployment
