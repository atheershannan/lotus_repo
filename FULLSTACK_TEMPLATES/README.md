## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Initialize Project**: Start with `Stage_01_Requirements_and_Planning/00_STAGE_OVERVIEW.prompt`
2. **Follow Dynamic Questions**: Answer context-aware questions for each stage
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor your progress in `ROADMAP.md`
4. **Continue to Implementation**: Start Stage 4 (Database Design & Implementation)
5. **Implement Code**: Create actual database, backend, and frontend code
6. **Test Implementation**: Run tests on actual code
7. **Iterate Safely**: Use reset mechanism if needed
8. **Deploy Automatically**: Complete deployment with GitHub Actions
9. **Monitor Production**: Track performance and user feedback
10. **Maintain and Scale**: Continuous improvement and scaling
11. **Iterate and Improve**: Ongoing development and enhancement
12. **Optimize and Enhance**: Continuous optimization and feature enhancement

## 🧬 Dynamic Question System

Every stage begins with intelligent questions that:
- Adapt based on previous stage outputs
- Detect inconsistencies automatically
- Block progression until all data is validated
- Provide context-aware follow-up questions
- Guide implementation decisions
- Support code development choices
- Guide testing decisions
- Guide production deployment decisions
- Guide continuous improvement decisions
- Guide iterative development decisions

## 🔄 Workflow Stages

1. **Requirements & Planning** - Project definition and user stories ✅
2. **System & Architecture** - Tech stack and system design ✅
3. **Project Flow** - User interactions and data flow ✅
4. **Database Design & Implementation** - Data models and relationships 🔄 (Current)
5. **Backend Development & Implementation** - API design and implementation
6. **Frontend Development & Implementation** - UI/UX and component structure
7. **QA & Testing** - Comprehensive testing strategy on actual code
8. **Deployment** - Production deployment and CI/CD

## 🛡️ Safety Features

- **Non-destructive operations** - No overwrites without confirmation
