# 🔄 STAGE 3: PROJECT FLOW

## 📋 Stage Overview

**Purpose**: Define user interactions and data flow
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Stage 2 ✅ Complete, ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md ✅ Validated
**Outputs**: Flow diagrams, Interaction logic, State management

## 🧬 Dynamic Question Phase

Before we start this stage, please answer the following questions:

### 1️⃣ User Journey Flow
**How do users navigate through your application?**
- Entry point: [How do users first access the app?]
- Onboarding flow: [What steps do new users take?]
- Main user flow: [What is the primary user journey?]
- Exit points: [How do users complete their tasks?]

### 2️⃣ Data Flow Patterns
**How does data move through your system?**
- Data sources: [Where does data come from?]
- Data transformations: [How is data processed?]
- Data storage: [Where is data stored?]
- Data synchronization: [How is data kept in sync?]

### 3️⃣ State Management
**How will you manage application state?**
- Global state: [What state needs to be shared across components?]
- Local state: [What state is component-specific?]
- State persistence: [How will state be persisted?]
- State synchronization: [How will state be synchronized?]

### 4️⃣ Real-time Features
**Do you need real-time functionality?**
- Real-time updates: [What needs to be real-time?]
- WebSocket usage: [Where will WebSockets be used?]
- Conflict resolution: [How will conflicts be handled?]
- Offline support: [What happens when offline?]

### 5️⃣ Error Handling
**How will you handle errors and edge cases?**
- Error types: [What types of errors can occur?]
- Error recovery: [How will users recover from errors?]
- Fallback strategies: [What fallbacks do you need?]
- User feedback: [How will you inform users of errors?]

## 🔄 Process Flow

1. **Answer Dynamic Questions** ← You are here
2. **Generate User Flow Diagrams**
3. **Design Data Flow Patterns**
4. **Plan State Management**
5. **Define Interaction Logic**
6. **Mark Stage Complete**

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] All dynamic questions answered
- [ ] User flow diagrams created
- [ ] Data flow patterns defined
- [ ] State management planned
- [ ] Interaction logic designed
- [ ] Error handling strategies defined
- [ ] Stage marked complete in ROADMAP.md

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

- **Over-complexity**: Keep flows simple and intuitive
- **Missing Edge Cases**: Consider error scenarios
- **State Confusion**: Clearly define state boundaries
- **Poor UX**: Focus on user experience

## 🔄 Next Steps

After completing this stage:
1. Review generated flow diagrams
2. Validate interaction logic
3. Mark stage complete in ROADMAP.md
4. Proceed to Stage 4: Backend Development
