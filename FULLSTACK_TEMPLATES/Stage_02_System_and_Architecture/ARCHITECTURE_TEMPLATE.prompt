## 🔍 ENTRY QUESTIONNAIRE

**BEFORE generating any content, answer these questions:**

### Requirements Review
1. **Review requirements from Stage 01 - What MVP features must we support?**
   - List the top 3-5 critical features

2. **What's the expected user load?**
   - Concurrent users: [number]
   - Requests per second: [number]
   - Example: "1000 concurrent users, 100 RPS"

3. **What are the hosting/deployment constraints?**
   - Cloud provider preference? (AWS/GCP/Azure/VPS)
   - Budget for hosting?
   - Example: "AWS, free tier for MVP"

### Technology Stack
4. **Backend framework preference?**
   - Node.js (Express/NestJS/Fastify)
   - Python (Django/FastAPI/Flask)
   - Java (Spring Boot)
   - .NET (ASP.NET Core)
   - Other: [specify]

5. **Frontend framework preference?**
   - React
   - Vue
   - Next.js
   - Angular
   - Other: [specify]

6. **Database preference?**
   - PostgreSQL
   - MySQL
   - MongoDB
   - SQLite
   - Other: [specify]

7. **Authentication method?**
   - JWT tokens
   - Session-based
   - OAuth (Google/GitHub)
   - Custom
   - Example: "JWT with refresh tokens"

### Architecture Pattern
8. **Which architecture pattern?**
   - REST API
   - GraphQL
   - Microservices
   - Serverless
   - Monolith (recommended for MVP)
   - Example: "REST API, monolith for MVP"

9. **Do you need real-time features?**
   - Yes, WebSockets needed
   - No, standard request/response
   - Example: "No real-time needed for MVP"

10. **What external services/integrations?**
    - Payment processing (Stripe/PayPal)
    - Email service (SendGrid/SES)
    - Storage (S3/GCS)
    - None for MVP
    - Example: "Stripe for payments, SendGrid for emails"

## 📝 TEMPLATE GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS

Based on your answers, generate:

### 1. System Architecture Diagram
**File:** `architecture_diagram.md`

Structure:
```markdown
# System Architecture

## Overview
[High-level description]

## Component Diagram
```
[ASCII or text diagram showing relationships]
```

## Data Flow
1. [User] → [Frontend]
2. [Frontend] → [Backend API]
3. [Backend] → [Database]
...

## Technology Stack
- Backend: [From Q4]
- Frontend: [From Q5]
- Database: [From Q6]
- Auth: [From Q7]
- Pattern: [From Q8]
```

### 2. Endpoints Specification
**File:** `ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md` ⚠️ CRITICAL FILE

This file defines all API contracts and is required before Stage 04!

Structure:
```markdown
# API Endpoints Specification

## Base URL
http://api.example.com

## Authentication
All requests require: Authorization: Bearer {token}

## Endpoints

### POST /api/auth/register
**Description:** Register new user
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```
**Response (201):**
```json
{
  "user": {...},
  "token": "string"
}
```

### [More endpoints...]
```

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This file is referenced by:
- Stage 03 (Project Flow)
- Stage 04 (Backend TDD Planning)
- Stage 08 (Implementation)

Generate ALL endpoints needed for MVP features!

## ✅ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before proceeding to Stage 03:
- [ ] Architecture diagram complete
- [ ] ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md created with all endpoints
- [ ] Tech stack justified
- [ ] Scalability considered
- [ ] Security architecture planned
- [ ] Entry questions answered

## 🚦 NEXT STAGE

Once architecture is complete and validated:
→ Proceed to **Stage 03: Project Flow**

**Unlock Condition:** ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md must be complete and all checklist items ✅
