## üéØ Stage Objectives

1. **Design System Architecture** - High-level system design
2. **Select Technology Stack** - Choose appropriate technologies
3. **Define API Endpoints** - Create comprehensive API specification
4. **Plan Security Architecture** - Design security measures
5. **Plan Integration Strategy** - Define external service integrations

## üìä Expected Outputs

### Architecture Design
- System architecture diagram
- Component relationships
- Data flow diagrams
- Security architecture

### Technology Stack
- Backend technologies
- Frontend technologies
- Database technologies
- Deployment technologies

### API Specification
- Complete ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling

## üîÑ Process Flow

1. **Answer Dynamic Questions** ‚Üê You are here
2. **Generate Architecture Design**
3. **Select Technology Stack**
4. **Create ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md**
5. **Validate and Review**
6. **Mark Stage Complete**

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All dynamic questions answered
- [ ] Architecture diagrams created
- [ ] Technology stack selected
- [ ] ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md generated and validated
- [ ] Security architecture planned
- [ ] Integration strategy defined
- [ ] Stage marked complete in ROADMAP.md

## üö® Common Pitfalls

- **Over-engineering**: Keep architecture simple for initial version
- **Technology Mismatch**: Ensure technologies work well together
- **Missing Security**: Don't overlook security considerations
- **Incomplete API Spec**: Ensure all endpoints are documented

## üîÑ Next Steps

After completing this stage:
1. Review generated architecture
2. Validate technology choices
3. Approve ENDPOINTS_SPEC.md
4. Mark stage complete in ROADMAP.md
5. Proceed to Stage 3: Project Flow
