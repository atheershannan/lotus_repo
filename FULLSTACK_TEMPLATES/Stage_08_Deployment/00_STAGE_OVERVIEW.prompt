## üîÑ Process Flow

1. **Answer Dynamic Questions** ‚Üê You are here
2. **Set up CI/CD Pipeline**
3. **Configure Production Environment**
4. **Implement Monitoring**
5. **Set up Security**
6. **Configure Backup**
7. **Deploy to Production**
8. **Mark Stage Complete**

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All dynamic questions answered
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working
- [ ] Production environment configured
- [ ] Monitoring implemented
- [ ] Security measures in place
- [ ] Backup configured
- [ ] Application deployed to production
- [ ] Stage marked complete in ROADMAP.md

## üö® Common Pitfalls

- **Incomplete CI/CD**: Ensure full automation
- **Missing Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring
- **Security Gaps**: Don't overlook security
- **No Backup Strategy**: Plan for disaster recovery

## üîÑ Next Steps

After completing this stage:
1. Verify production deployment
2. Test monitoring and alerting
3. Mark stage complete in ROADMAP.md
4. Project complete! üéâ
