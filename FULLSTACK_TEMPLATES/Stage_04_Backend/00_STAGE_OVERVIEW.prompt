# ⚙️ STAGE 4: BACKEND DEVELOPMENT

## 📋 Stage Overview

**Purpose**: Implement backend API and services
**Duration**: 8-12 hours
**Dependencies**: Stage 3 ✅ Complete
**Outputs**: Backend API, Test suites, Code reviews

## 🧬 Dynamic Question Phase

Before we start this stage, please answer the following questions:

### 1️⃣ API Implementation Strategy
**How will you implement the API endpoints?**
- Framework choice: [Express.js, NestJS, FastAPI, Django, etc.]
- API structure: [RESTful, GraphQL, or hybrid?]
- Authentication: [JWT, OAuth, Session-based?]
- Validation: [What validation libraries will you use?]

### 2️⃣ Database Integration
**How will you integrate with the database?**
- ORM choice: [Prisma, TypeORM, Sequelize, etc.]
- Database migrations: [How will you handle schema changes?]
- Query optimization: [What optimization strategies will you use?]
- Caching: [Redis, Memcached, or database caching?]

### 3️⃣ Testing Strategy
**What testing approach will you use?**
- Testing framework: [Jest, Mocha, Pytest, etc.]
- Test types: [Unit, integration, e2e tests?]
- Test coverage: [What coverage percentage do you want?]
- Mocking: [What mocking libraries will you use?]

### 4️⃣ Security Implementation
**How will you implement security?**
- Input validation: [What validation libraries?]
- SQL injection prevention: [Parameterized queries, ORM?]
- XSS protection: [Content Security Policy, input sanitization?]
- Rate limiting: [What rate limiting strategy?]

### 5️⃣ Error Handling
**How will you handle errors and logging?**
- Error handling: [Centralized error handling?]
- Logging: [Winston, Pino, or built-in logging?]
- Monitoring: [What monitoring tools will you use?]
- Debugging: [What debugging strategies?]
