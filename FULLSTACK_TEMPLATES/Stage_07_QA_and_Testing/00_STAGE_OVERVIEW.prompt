**What is the scope of your testing requirements?**
- Test types: [Unit, integration, e2e, performance, security?]
- Test coverage: [Target coverage percentage?]
- Test environments: [Dev, staging, production testing?]
- Test data: [Synthetic data, production data, masked data?]

### 2️⃣ Quality Metrics
**What quality metrics are important for your project?**
- Performance metrics: [Response time, throughput, resource usage?]
- Reliability metrics: [Uptime, error rate, availability?]
- Security metrics: [Vulnerability count, security score?]
- User experience: [Usability, accessibility, user satisfaction?]

### 3️⃣ Testing Tools
**What testing tools and frameworks will you use?**
- Unit testing: [Jest, Mocha, Pytest, etc.]
- Integration testing: [Supertest, Postman, etc.]
- E2E testing: [Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, etc.]
- Performance testing: [LoadRunner, JMeter, K6, etc.]

### 4️⃣ Test Automation
**How will you automate your testing?**
- CI/CD integration: [GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins?]
- Test execution: [Parallel, sequential, hybrid?]
- Test reporting: [HTML reports, dashboard, notifications?]
- Test maintenance: [Test data management, test cleanup?]

### 5️⃣ Quality Gates
**What are your quality gates and acceptance criteria?**
- Code coverage: [Minimum coverage percentage?]
- Performance benchmarks: [Response time thresholds?]
