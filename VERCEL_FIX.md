# ðŸ”§ Fix Vercel Deployment Error

## Problem
```
sh: line 1: cd: FRONTEND: No such file or directory
```

Vercel is trying to run commands from the wrong directory.

## âœ… Solution: Configure in Vercel Dashboard

**This MUST be done in the Vercel Dashboard**, not in the code.

### Steps:

1. **Go to Vercel**: https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. **Select your project**

3. **Settings â†’ General**

4. **Root Directory** section:
   - Click "Edit"
   - Change from `.` to `FRONTEND`
   - Click "Continue"

5. **Save**

6. **Redeploy**:
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Find the failed deployment
   - Click "..." menu â†’ "Redeploy"

## Why This Happens

When you set Root Directory:
- Vercel runs all commands from that directory
- `package.json` is found at `FRONTEND/package.json`
- Build output goes to `FRONTEND/build/`
- No need for `cd FRONTEND` in commands

## Alternative: Create New Project

If updating Root Directory doesn't work:

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/new
2. **Import repository**
3. **Configure**:
   - **Root Directory**: `FRONTEND`
   - **Framework Preset**: Create React App
4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Add `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://lotusrepo-production-0265.up.railway.app/api`
5. **Deploy**

**Important**: You MUST set Root Directory in Vercel Dashboard for this to work!
