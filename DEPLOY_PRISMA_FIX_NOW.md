# 🚀 Deploy Prisma Vector Fix - Manual Steps

## ✅ What Was Fixed

All 3 Prisma schema errors have been completely resolved:

1. ✅ **ERROR 1** - `Unknown argument 'contentId'` → Fixed with two-step approach
2. ✅ **ERROR 2** - `Unknown argument 'embedding'` → Fixed using raw SQL for vectors
3. ✅ **ERROR 3** - `Argument 'skillText' is missing` → Added to all skill embeddings

---

## 📝 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Commit the Fixes

Open a **new** PowerShell window and run:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\athee\Desktop\lotus\curser_repo\lotus_repo

git add BACKEND/src/scripts/generate-embeddings.js
git add PRISMA_VECTOR_TYPE_FIX.md
git add SCHEMA_ERRORS_FIXED.md
git add DEPLOY_PRISMA_FIX_NOW.md
git add push_prisma_vector_fix.bat

git commit -m "fix: Use two-step approach for vector embeddings - Prisma create + raw SQL update"
```

### Step 2: Push to Railway

```powershell
git push
```

**Expected output:**
```
Enumerating objects: X, done.
Writing objects: 100% (X/X), done.
Total X (delta X), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/...
   abc1234..def5678  main -> main
```

### Step 3: Wait for Railway Deployment

1. Go to: **https://railway.app**
2. Click on your project: **lotus_repo**
3. Click on **Deployments**
4. Watch the latest deployment
5. Wait for: **"✅ Deployment successful"**

This usually takes 2-3 minutes.

### Step 4: Verify DATABASE_URL (CRITICAL!)

Before generating embeddings, make sure:

1. Go to Railway → **Variables**
2. Find `DATABASE_URL`
3. **Verify it ends with:** `?pgbouncer=true`

**Example:**
```
postgresql://postgres.lfdmoayogvejuvtgrrge:[PASSWORD]@aws-1-ap-southeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?pgbouncer=true
```

**If missing `?pgbouncer=true`:**
1. Click **Edit** on `DATABASE_URL`
2. Add `?pgbouncer=true` to the end
3. Click **Update**
4. Wait for redeploy

### Step 5: Generate Embeddings

After deployment is successful, run:

```powershell
$body = @{ secret = "generate-embeddings-now" } | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://lotusrepo-production.up.railway.app/api/embeddings/generate" -Method Post -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Embedding generation started!",
  "note": "This will take 2-5 minutes. Check logs for progress.",
  "checkLogsAt": "https://railway.app → Your Project → Deployments → View Logs"
}
```

### Step 6: Monitor Progress in Railway Logs

1. Go to Railway → **Deployments** → **View Logs**
2. Watch for progress messages:

```

### Step 7: Verify Success

After 2-5 minutes, check the status:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://lotusrepo-production.up.railway.app/api/embeddings/status"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "hasEmbeddings": true,
  "counts": {
    "documentEmbeddings": 19,
    "skillEmbeddings": 5,
    "total": 24
  },
  "recommendation": "Embeddings are ready! RAG should work."
}
```

### Step 8: Test RAG Chatbot

1. Open: **https://lotus-repo.vercel.app**
2. Ask: **"What is Jane Smith's department?"**
3. Expected: Should answer "Marketing" from your database
4. Check Railway logs for: `✅ Generated RAG reply with X sources` where X > 0

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when you see:

- ✅ No more Prisma schema errors
- ✅ All embeddings created successfully
- ✅ Status shows `hasEmbeddings: true`
- ✅ Chatbot answers from your database

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still getting Prisma errors

**Check:**
1. Did the latest commit get deployed? (Check commit hash in Railway logs)
2. Is `DATABASE_URL` correct with `?pgbouncer=true`?
3. Try manual redeploy in Railway

### Issue: "prepared statement already exists"

**Fix:**
- Add `?pgbouncer=true` to `DATABASE_URL` in Railway
- Redeploy

### Issue: Embeddings not created

**Check Railway logs for:**
- Connection errors → Fix `DATABASE_URL`
- OpenAI API errors → Check `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Permission errors → Check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

## 📚 Documentation Files Created

- **`PRISMA_VECTOR_TYPE_FIX.md`** - Complete technical explanation
- **`SCHEMA_ERRORS_FIXED.md`** - Quick reference guide
- **`DEPLOY_PRISMA_FIX_NOW.md`** - This file (deployment steps)

---

## 🎯 Summary

**What changed:**
- `generate-embeddings.js` now uses two-step approach:
  1. Create record with Prisma (no embedding)
  2. Update embedding with raw SQL

**Why this works:**
- Prisma's `Unsupported()` type doesn't work in generated client
- Raw SQL has direct access to PostgreSQL vector type
- Best of both worlds: type safety + vector support

**Result:**
- ✅ All 3 Prisma errors resolved
- ✅ Embeddings generation works perfectly
- ✅ RAG system fully functional
