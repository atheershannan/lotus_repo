# üö® CORS Error - Solution

## ‚ùå Problem
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest has been blocked by CORS policy: 
No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present
```

Frontend Vercel: `https://lotus-repo.vercel.app`
Backend Railway: `https://lotusrepo-production-0265.up.railway.app`

## ‚úÖ CORS Configuration (Already Correct!)

Backend already has CORS configured with `origin: '*'`:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: '*',  // Allow all origins
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'X-Requested-With']
}));
```

## üîß Solution: Restart Railway Service

The CORS config is correct, but Railway needs to reload it.

### Steps:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard:**
   - https://railway.app/dashboard

2. **Find your service** (lotusrepo-production)

3. **Click on the service**

4. **Click "Restart"** or "Redeploy"

5. **Wait for deployment to complete**

6. **Try the chatbot again**

## üéØ Why This Works

- CORS config is correct in code
- Railway just needs to reload the updated configuration
- Restart forces Railway to pick up the CORS settings

## ‚úÖ After Restart

The chatbot should work! Try sending a message.
