# ðŸ”„ REQUIREMENTS ADJUSTMENTS SUMMARY

## ðŸ“‹ Based on Pseudocode Dialogue Review

**Project Name**: Contextual Corporate Assistant RAG/GRAPH
**Review Date**: December 2024
**Status**: Requirements Refined

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Adjustments Made

### 1. **RAG Accuracy Requirements Refined**
- **Original**: >90% accuracy rate
- **Adjusted**: >85% accuracy rate (initial), >90% accuracy rate (long-term goal)
- **Rationale**: More realistic initial target with iterative improvement path

### 2. **Microservice Integration Approach**
- **Original**: Simultaneous integration with all 10+ microservices
- **Adjusted**: Phased integration starting with core 3-4 services (Course Builder, Skills Engine, Content Studio, Assessment)
- **Rationale**: Reduces implementation risk and allows for thorough testing

### 3. **Knowledge Graph Update Frequency**
- **Original**: Real-time updates as content evolves
- **Adjusted**: Near real-time updates (every few minutes initially), optimizing to real-time
- **Rationale**: Balances performance requirements with technical feasibility

### 4. **Technology Stack Clarification**
- **Added**: Neo4j as preferred knowledge graph technology
- **Rationale**: Purpose-built for complex relationships, better RAG integration, superior testing tools

### 5. **Enhanced Success Metrics**
- **Added**: Knowledge Graph Coverage >95% of corporate content indexed
- **Added**: Learning Efficiency >50% reduction in search time
- **Added**: Learning Outcomes >25% increase in completion rates
- **Rationale**: More comprehensive measurement of system effectiveness
